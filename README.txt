asylumRL
a seven-day roguelike for 7drl2012
by scotchfield (scott)
-------------------------------------------------------------
please run with python2.6!
you'll also need pygame (for the sound libraries) and libtcod (for the console rendering and much more)
i'm pretty sure that libtcod is the best thing since sliced bread.
pygame is kind of OK too!
-------------------------------------------------------------
this code is released into the public domain.
please sell it for a million dollars!  and then tell me, and make me jealous.

several sounds from the game were obtained from freesound.org and resampled:
"Barrel Break 1.wav" by kevinkace: http://www.freesound.org/people/kevinkace/sounds/66769/
"crash.wav" by sagetyrtle: http://www.freesound.org/people/sagetyrtle/sounds/40158/
"Heartbeat.wav" by jobro: http://www.freesound.org/people/jobro/sounds/74829/
"OhDearScare.wav" by TheGoliath: http://www.freesound.org/people/TheGoliath/sounds/124954/
"water step.wav" by nathanaelj83: http://www.freesound.org/people/nathanaelj83/sounds/145242/
-------------------------------------------------------------
procedural cave generation is based on jim babcock's cellular automata method:

which is totally nice, and i like it.  and him.

pythonic enums are taken from alec thomas's answer on stackoverflow:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36932/whats-the-best-way-to-implement-an-enum-in-python
thank you for simplifying a lot of simple issues!  i didn't use enums in a truly efficient way in this
7drl, but this is very helpful code.

there's a lot of stuff that still needs to go into this game!
bad guys are called stalkers.  they need some scary sounds when you see them.
the story isn't really balanced.  things hit you kind of fast.  hey, seven days, come on!
in fact, it would be nice if the whole story was longer.
did i mention that amnesia is a great game?  amnesia is a great game.
